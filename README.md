# The Thrush Package Manager 

The Thrush package manager (**throium**) is the high-level representation of the Thrush compiler, responsible for managing compilation, installation, dependency management, project creation, and successful compilation of each project.

## Getting Started

You must first download the installers for your operating system. For Windows, follow the steps in the installer. For Linux, it's automatic.
